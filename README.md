# DMART-Store-Sales-Dashboard
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize DMart’s sales performance across products, regions, and time periods. The dashboard provides key insights into total sales, profit margins, top-performing categories, and customer trends. It includes dynamic filters and visuals for easy comparison and data-driven decision-making. The project demonstrates strong data modeling, DAX measures, and visual design skills for retail business analytics.
